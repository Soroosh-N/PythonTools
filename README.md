# PythonTools
This is a repository of python tools that I write to reduce my dependency on installing different applications. A simple code is better than installing a resource-consuming application for each task.

* PDF2PIC_conv : PDF to Picture converter
* PDF_merge: Merge all pdfs in a folder to one resulted PDF
